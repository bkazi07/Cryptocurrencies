# Module 18 Challenge

## Overview
This project’s objective is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and to group them to create a classification system. 
The deliverables for this project are:
1) Preprocess the data for Principal 	Component Analysis (PCA)
2) Reduce Data Dimensions using PCA
3) Cluster cryptocurrencies using K-means
4) Visualize cryptocurrencies results

I have then prepared data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means. I have also reduced data dimensions using PCA and the completion of this task results in the df_crypto_scaled_pca dataframe:

Then I clustered cryptocurrencies using K-Means; first creating an Elbow Curve to find the best value for k. Once I determined the k value that I thought best fits, I used the k-means clustering algorithm to the predict the k clusters for the processed data.
The results for that are below:
